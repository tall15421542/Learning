# GRPC load balancing in k8s cluster: Experiment
## Pre-reading
* [GRPC load balancing in k8s cluster](https://hackmd.io/6Q-UKmWcQuqx6I5NkIUQlQ?view)
## API
### /experiment/client?type={client_type}&n={concurrent_reqs}
* client_type: the grpc client we use to send data to greeter server
    * Client: Create new channel for every request
    * ClientWithReuseConn: Create channel initially and reuse that channel for further requests.
    * ClientWithKubeResolver: Use [kubeResolver](https://github.com/sercand/kuberesolver/tree/master) as a grpc name resolver. It would monitor the Greeter-service and resolve the ips behind it dynamically.
* concurrent_reqs: It's the number of concurrent requests we send to greeter-server in the experiment.
## Architecture

### KubeResolver

## Prerequiste
* [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/): A local kubernetes control plane.
* For kubeResolver, we should give service account in the greeter-client pod `GET` and `WATCH` access for resource `endpoints`.

## How to start the greeter-client & greeter-server
1. Start cluster: `minikube start`
2. (Optional) Enable local build registry
    * Run `eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)`, point your terminalâ€™s docker-cli to the Docker Engine inside minikube. ([minikube handbook](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/#1-pushing-directly-to-the-in-cluster-docker-daemon-docker-env))
3. Build greeter-client & greeter-server image: `make build-image`
4. Deploy server: `kubectl apply -f k8s/server.yaml`
5. Deploy client: `kubectl apply -f k8s/client.yaml`
    * For kubeResolver, we should also give `default` service account RBAC access for `endpoints`: `kubectl apply -f k8s/client-rbac.yaml`
6. Open tunnel to the greeter-client NodePort: in the other terminal, run `minikube service greeter-client`
7. Run experiment: `curl "localhost:{port_from_step_7}/?type={client_type}&n={concurrent_reqs}"`

## Experiment
### Client v.s ClientWithReuseConn


|  | Client | ClientWithReuseConn |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| n = 1000     | 687.692001ms    | 522.581208ms    |
| n = 2000     | 1.036497709s     | 547.844917ms     |
| n = 3000     | Crash     | 558.110917ms     |
| n = 10000     | Crash     | 735.631459ms     |

#### LoadBalancing
* Client
```
"count_per_ip":{
  "10.244.0.103":684,
  "10.244.0.105":662,
  "10.244.0.113":654
}
```
* ClientWithReuseConn
```
"count_per_ip":{"10.244.0.113":2000}
```

#### Comment
1. Reconnect for every request is slow. If we ignore the server sleep time 500ms, `Client` takes 8.5x~10x time than `ClientWithReuseConn`.
2. For 3000 concurrent requests, `Client` would crash due to the resource surge, while it only takes little overhead for `ClientWithReuseConn`
3. `Client` load balancing policy is more complicated than round-robin, but it's still closed to evenly distributed in our workload
4. `ClientWithReuseConn` does not have load-balancing at all.

### ClientWithResueConn v.s ClientWithKubeResolver(Replica=3)
|  | ClientWithReuseConn | ClientWithKubeResolver |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| n = 1000     |522.581208ms    | 513.53575ms |
| n = 2000     | 547.844917ms   |  548.33675ms|
| n = 3000     | 558.110917ms   |  533.248667ms|
| n = 10000     | 735.631459ms  |  699.490834ms |
#### LoadBalancing
* ClientWithReuseConn
```
"count_per_ip":{"10.244.0.113":10000}
```
* ClientWithKubeResolver
```
"count_per_ip":{
  "10.244.0.103":3334,
  "10.244.0.105":3333,
  "10.244.0.113":3333
}
```
#### Comment
1. HTTP/2 and Protobuf is efficient: Efficiency of one connection is as good as load-balancing in our workload. It does not need to open an new connection even when we have 10000 concurrent request.
2. KubeResolver successfully load balancing using round-robin, but it would not consider the server state.

### ClientWithKubeResolver with scaling up or down
#### Scale up to 10 replica
* `kubectl scale deployments/greeter-server --replicas=10`
* During the process of scaling
```
"count_per_ip":{
  "10.244.0.103":500,
  "10.244.0.105":500,
  "10.244.0.113":500,
  "10.244.0.122":500
}
```
* After Scaling is done
```
"count_per_ip":{
  "10.244.0.103":200,
  "10.244.0.105":200,
  "10.244.0.113":200,
  "10.244.0.121":200,
  "10.244.0.122":200,
  "10.244.0.123":200,
  "10.244.0.124":200,
  "10.244.0.125":200,
  "10.244.0.126":200,
  "10.244.0.127":200
}
```
#### Kill one pod
* Before we kill a pod
```
"count_per_ip":{
  "10.244.0.103":666,
  "10.244.0.105":667,
  "10.244.0.113":667
}
```
* After we kill a pod
    * `kubectl delete pod {pod_name}`
    * We can see one of ips changes from "10.244.0.105" to "10.244.0.128"
```
"count_per_ip":{
  "10.244.0.103":667,
  "10.244.0.113":666,
  "10.244.0.128":667
}
```

#### Scale down to 2 replica
* `kubectl scale deployments/greeter-server --replicas=2`
```
"count_per_ip":{
  "10.244.0.103":1000,
  "10.244.0.113":1000
}
```

## Author's Conclusion
Consider our [checkout workload](https://app.datadoghq.eu/apm/resource/dine-in-api/http.request/4d096aeeda6b8292?query=%40_top_level%3A1%20env%3Aproduction%20service%3Adine-in-api%20operation_name%3Ahttp.request%20resource_name%3A%22POST%20%2Fpayment%2Fcheckout%22&env=production&hostGroup=%2A&spanType=service-entry&topGraphs=latency%3Alatency%2Chits%3Aversion_rate%2Cerrors%3Aversion_count%2CbreakdownAs%3Apercentage&traces=qson%3A%28data%3A%28%29%2Cversion%3A%210%29&start=1687080277534&end=1689672277534&paused=false) for now is low(< 1 req/s). I think `ClientWithKubeResolver` is a good enough approach because
1. We can avoid blocking `GetConnection` operation by reusing the channel.
2. Even when our business scales up, we can evenly distribute the workload even when the pods scales. Though we don't consider the server state, the client load balancing is enough to avoid hot-spot and reduce overhead for a single server.
